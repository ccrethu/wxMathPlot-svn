wxmathplot (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial DEB Release.
  * Added mpX_DATE and mpX_DATETIME formats for X axis.
  * Axes labels' format can now be set using the SetLabelFormat function, so the user can select the appropriate format fitting his needs.
  * Introduced mpWindow::SetColourTheme to set background and foreground colors different from default black on white. mpPrintout will continue to print everything with white background.
  * Fixed drawing of labels for mpFX, mpFY and mpFXY. It is not really meaningful to use the label for mpFXY objects and similar ones: it is recommended to use mpInfoLegend instead, it is more clear and elegant.
  * Fixed evaluation of m_posY in mpWindow::Fit (margin top to be added, not subtracted)
  * Fixed mpFXYVector (and mpFXY) which did not respected margins when set as continuous
  * Can now build as a DLL on Windows (works only if wxWidgets are built as DLL): patch by zundoya
  * Reimplemented scrollers: patch by ngpaton
  * MATHPLOT_DO_LOGGING is now an option to be enabled by CMake building
  * Minor fixes.
